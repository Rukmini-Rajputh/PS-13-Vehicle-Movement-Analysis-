Project Title: Vehicle Movement Analysis and Insight Generation in College Campus Using EdgeAI

Team Members:
Rukmini (Team Leader)
Prerana
Revati

Contributions:

Rukmini (Team Leader):
Led the project and coordinated team efforts.
Managed data collection using EdgeAI-enabled devices.

Prerana:
Handled data preprocessing and cleaning.
Conducted descriptive and time series analyses.

Revati:
Developed clustering algorithms and predictive models.
Implemented real-time alerting systems with EdgeAI.

The team utilized EdgeAI technologies to analyze vehicle movements and generate actionable insights, improving traffic management and safety on the college campus.

Challenges and Solutions:

Challenge: Inconsistent Data Collection
Solution: The team faced issues with inconsistent data collection due to intermittent network connectivity. To overcome this, Rukmini led the implementation of 
local storage solutions on EdgeAI devices, ensuring data was temporarily stored and later synchronized when connectivity was restored.

Challenge: Data Quality and Preprocessing
Solution: Prerana encountered challenges with data quality, including missing values and outliers. She developed robust preprocessing scripts to clean the data,
employing techniques like interpolation for missing values and statistical methods to handle outliers.

Challenge: Model Accuracy
Solution: Revati initially faced difficulties achieving high accuracy with predictive models due to the variability in traffic patterns. She refined the models by 
incorporating additional features such as weather conditions and implemented cross-validation techniques to improve model performance.

The team successfully overcame these challenges, leveraging their combined expertise to utilize EdgeAI technologies for analyzing vehicle movements and generating
actionable insights, ultimately enhancing traffic management and safety on the college campus.
