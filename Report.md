# Vehicle Movement Analysis and Insight Generation in College Campus Using EdgeAI

## 1. Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a system for vehicle movement analysis and insight generation within a college campus using edge AI techniques. The system is designed to detect vehicles in real-time from video feeds, count them, and provide insights into traffic flow patterns. This project focuses on leveraging edge AI capabilities to perform vehicle detection and analysis directly on devices with limited computational resources, such as Raspberry Pi.

## 2. Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project consists of a video feed (`campus_traffic.mp4`) captured within the college campus. Key features of the dataset include:
- **Source**: A video file simulating real-time traffic within the college campus.
- **Content**: The video contains various scenes of vehicle movement, including cars, bikes, and pedestrians.
- **Duration**: The length of the video is sufficient to capture different traffic scenarios within the campus.
- **Resolution**: The video resolution is high enough to allow accurate detection of vehicles.

## 3. Methodology
### Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: The programming language used for developing the solution.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for video processing and computer vision tasks.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: A pre-trained model for vehicle detection.

### Steps
1. **Initialization**:
    - Load the video feed using OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture`).
    - Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for vehicle detection (`vehicle_detection.xml`).

2. **Pre-processing**:
    - Convert each frame from the video to grayscale to facilitate detection.

3. **Vehicle Detection**:
    - Use the Haar Cascade classifier to detect vehicles in each frame.
    - Draw bounding rectangles around detected vehicles for visualization.

4. **Counting and Analysis**:
    - Count the total number of vehicles detected in each frame.
    - Accumulate the vehicle count for the entire video sequence.
    - Display real-time vehicle counts on each frame.

5. **Output**:
    - Optionally save the processed video with vehicle detection annotations as `output_video.avi`.

### Code
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Function to detect vehicles in a frame
def detect_vehicles(frame, vehicle_cascade):
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    vehicles = vehicle_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
    return vehicles

# Function to count vehicles and draw rectangles
def draw_vehicle_rectangles(frame, vehicles):
    for (x, y, w, h) in vehicles:
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Main function to process video feed
def main(video_source, output_video_path=None):
    # Load pre-trained vehicle detection model (replace with appropriate model)
    vehicle_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('vehicle_detection.xml')
    
    # Initialize video capture
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_source)
    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Error: Could not open video source.")
        return
    
    # Get video properties
    width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
    height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
    fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    
    # Initialize video writer if output path is provided
    if output_video_path:
        fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'XVID')
        out = cv2.VideoWriter(output_video_path, fourcc, fps, (width, height))
    else:
        out = None
    
    # Variables for vehicle counting
    total_vehicles = 0
    
    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        
        # Detect vehicles
        vehicles = detect_vehicles(frame, vehicle_cascade)
        
        # Draw rectangles around vehicles
        draw_vehicle_rectangles(frame, vehicles)
        
        # Count total vehicles detected
        total_vehicles += len(vehicles)
        
        # Display frame with vehicle detection
        cv2.putText(frame, f'Total Vehicles: {total_vehicles}', (50, 50), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (255, 0, 0), 2)
        cv2.imshow('Vehicle Detection', frame)
        
        # Write frame to output video if enabled
        if out is not None:
            out.write(frame)
        
        # Exit loop when 'q' is pressed
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
    
    # Release capture and close windows
    cap.release()
    if out is not None:
        out.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Replace 'campus_traffic.mp4' with your video source
if __name__ == '__main__':
    video_source = 'campus_traffic.mp4'
    output_video_path = 'output_video.avi'  # Replace with None if no output video is needed
    main(video_source, output_video_path)
